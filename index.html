  <h1>Loops and Conditionals</h1>
  <p>Conditionals and loops are two of the most important concepts in JavaScript.</p>
  <p>A <strong>conditional</strong> says, "If something is <em>true</em>, do this. Otherwise, do that."</p>
  <p>A <strong>loop</strong> says, "As long as something is <em>true</em>, keep doing this." </p>
